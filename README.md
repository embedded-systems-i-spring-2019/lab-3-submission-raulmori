# Instructions

-In Part1, we simply design a TOP-design calle "UART", and we simply add to it, 2 files called 
"uart_tx" (receving side) and uart_rx" (sending side)

-In Part2 we create a TOP-design. The "Top-design is called "sender_top". We then add to it everything from part1 , as well as a new file we make called "sender".  We also add a "Modified-ClockDivider", and a standard Debounced-Button.
 
--Remember we always add the extension "vhd" to all our files so that we can get the nice color GitHub-made color added to our
code
